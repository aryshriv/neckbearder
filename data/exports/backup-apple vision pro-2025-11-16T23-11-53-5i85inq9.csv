t3_1oz00f3,An Issue With Apple TV On M1 Macbook Pro,"I have an M1 macbook pro running macOS Tahoe 26.1.

  
I have an issue where movies from my library on Apple TV won't play and they stay at 00:00 at a black screen. Apple TV library movies work fine on my iphone and ipad. 

I've tried restarting, re-authorizing my macbook, logging out and logging back in, and re-installing macOS and none of it worked. I can't even airplay apple TV from my iphone/ipad to my macbook. When I try, it just stays at a black screen with a loading wheel forever.

Has anyone else had this issue and was it fixed?",https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/1oz00f3/an_issue_with_apple_tv_on_m1_macbook_pro/,,0,2025-11-16T23:01:49.000Z,0,[]
t3_1oz04t2,Do I need an iPad,If anyone owns an iPad and could tell me pros/cons of an iPad Air or pro I’ve been thinking of getting one for school and some light gaming purposes is it good to take notes on aka using the Apple Pencil is it financially worth it if I already have a Mac and is going up to the much higher price point of the iPad Pro worth it over the air I would realistically not need it for much else other than school and light gaming any any advise appreciated!,https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/1oz04t2/do_i_need_an_ipad/,,0,2025-11-16T23:06:55.000Z,0,[]
t3_1oz00cm,"What Laptop for video editing, occasional gaming and general browsing?","I (33 F)haven’t got space for a desktop pc. So I’m looking for a laptop that can smoothly edit 4K videos and also I can play games on Steam. I’ve found the GIGABYTE A16 16"" Gaming Laptop - Intel® Core™ i7, RTX 5050, 1 TB SSD

Or do I go with an APPLE MacBook Pro 14"" (2025) - M5, 1 TB SSD and sacrifice the gaming element and just use my Xbox Series X and not use steam. As I say I’m not a massive gamer and have only just got into gaming at 33. Or do I choose something else entirely.

I haven’t had a laptop in over 10 years and mainly use my iPad for video editing. So I’ve got nothing to compare it to. Any suggestions would be appreciated. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1oz00cm/what_laptop_for_video_editing_occasional_gaming/,,0,2025-11-16T23:01:45.000Z,0,[]

t3_1oyznz3,I've tried to like Mac OS 26.1 but it's just such a hot mess. I'm back to what I know works.,"I work with computers every single day and my trusty old Mac is my workhorse. It's the last of the i9 CPU MacBooks and for the most part, she's quick, reliable and doubles as a lap warmer if I give her anything intensive, but it all WORKS and works consistently.  
Along came Mac OS 26 with Liquid Ass ... The menu bar glitches out on my external screens, transparency issues aplenty, random 100% CPU usage for no apparent reason and those are just some of the myriad of weird stuff I experienced with Mac OS 26. I even tried a clean install ... that was somehow worse than the upgrade.  
For a 'Premium' product it's also been as glitchy on my iPhone and iPad Pro ... it's really really disappointing in Apple to release such a shoddy product.  
Also, why no dark icons for Pages, Numbers and Keynote ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/1oyznz3/ive_tried_to_like_mac_os_261_but_its_just_such_a/,,0,2025-11-16T22:47:29.000Z,0,[]

Apple M3 Pro chip 12-core CPU (6 high performance and 6 efficiency cores), 16-core Neural Engine and 18-core GPU.
